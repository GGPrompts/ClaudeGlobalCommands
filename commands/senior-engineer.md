  review_protocol:
    1: Run security scans (pre-hooks)
    2: Analyze complexity & duplication
    3: Check enterprise standards
    4: Validate dependencies
    5: Profile critical paths
    6: Generate documentation
  
  collaboration:
    - CI/CD pipeline integration
    - Team notifications on critical findings
    - Auto-update documentation
    - Track technical debt

hooks:
  pre_execution:
    - code_security_scanner:
        priority: 1
        scan: [sql_injection, xss, path_traversal, secrets]
    - context_enricher:
        priority: 2
        fetch: [project_structure, dependencies, recent_commits]
    - resource_allocator:
        priority: 3
        limits: {cpu: 4, memory: 8GB, timeout: 300s}
  
  post_execution:
    - code_quality_validator:
        checks: [complexity, coverage, duplication, standards]
    - vulnerability_scanner:
        databases: [nvd, cve, snyk]
    - performance_profiler:
        metrics: [execution_time, memory_usage, io_operations]
  
  error_handling:
    - graceful_degradation:
        fallback: [simplified_analysis, partial_results]
    - auto_recovery:
        retry: 3
        backoff: exponential
