## Introduction

The Claude Code Hooks system enables pre-processing, monitoring, post-processing, and error handling capabilities for all commands in the CCGlobalCommands system.

## Hook Types and Lifecycle

### Pre-execution Hooks
- Input validation
- Security scanning
- Resource allocation
- Context enrichment

### Execution Hooks
- Real-time monitoring
- Progress tracking
- Performance profiling

### Post-execution Hooks
- Result processing
- Notifications
- Audit logging
- Cleanup

### Error Handling Hooks
- Automatic recovery
- Incident creation
- Rollback procedures

## Configuration

Hooks are configured through YAML files in the `hooks-config` directory:
- `global-hooks.yaml`: Applied to all commands
- `command-hooks.yaml`: Command-specific hooks
- `environment-hooks.yaml`: Environment-specific hooks

## Implementation

See the complete implementation guide in the hooks-config directory for detailed examples and patterns.

## VS Code Integration

The VS Code integration enables browser development tools and visual testing capabilities through the extension configuration in `vscode-integration/extension-config.json`.

## Testing

Use the test script in `hooks-runtime/scripts/test-hooks.js` to validate your hook configurations.

## Best Practices

1. Keep hooks small and focused
2. Handle errors gracefully
3. Log all actions for debugging
4. Make hooks configurable
5. Test hooks thoroughly
