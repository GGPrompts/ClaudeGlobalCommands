cd CCGlobalCommands

# Use commands directly
cat commands/guide.md | claude
```

### Option 2: Claude Code Integration

# Copy to Claude Code commands directory
cp -r commands/* ~/.claude/commands/
cp -r workflows/* ~/.claude/workflows/
```

### Option 3: Selective Installation
```bash

cp commands/{guide,agents,senior-engineer,workflows}.md ~/.claude/commands/

# Add specific workflows
cp workflows/{css-safety-check,visual-testing}.md ~/.claude/workflows/
```

## 📊 Token Usage Guidelines

### Command Categories
- **🟢 Light** (500-1,500 tokens): Help, directory commands
- **🟡 Medium** (1,500-3,000 tokens): Single agent tasks
- **🟠 Heavy** (3,000-5,000 tokens): Complex analysis
- **🔴 Intensive** (5,000+ tokens): Multi-agent workflows

### Cost Management Tips
1. Start with light commands for exploration
2. Use workflows for complex tasks to minimize token waste
3. Leverage the `/execute` command for intelligent routing
4. Monitor usage with token estimates provided

## 🛠️ Development

### Adding New Commands
```yaml
# Follow the optimized YAML structure
role: "Your agent's role and expertise"
motivation: "Why this agent exists"
core_function: "🎯 Primary purpose in one line"
token_estimate: "X,XXX-X,XXX tokens per request"
responsibilities:
  - List of key capabilities
  - Specific and actionable items
```

### Testing Commands
```bash
# Validate YAML syntax
python setup/utilities/prompt-validator.py commands/new-command.md

# Count tokens
python setup/utilities/token-counter.py commands/new-command.md
```
